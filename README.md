# ML5G-PS-005_MLAB-NFP
This code present our results to ML5G-PS-005: Network failure prediction on CNFs 5GC with Linux eBPF.<br>
The goal of this challenge is to check how early and accurately the future network failures can be predicted using 3 types of metrics
The target value for prediction is the number of registration failure at 10 minutes.

There are 2 different tasks.<br>
  In task 1, all 3326 metrics are used for predicting the number of registration failure at 10 mintues. <br>
  In task 2, a part of metrics are selected for the same prediction.<br>

Details about the challenge are available at https://challenge.aiforgood.itu.int/match/matchitem/64
